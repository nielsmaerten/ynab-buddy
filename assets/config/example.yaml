##   YNAB BUDDY CONFIGURATION FILE      ##
##########################################

#   Welcome to the ynab-buddy configuation file!

#   Using this file, you'll teach ynab-buddy how to process transaction files from your bank(s).
#   Follow the instructions in each section, top to bottom. 
#   You only need to do this once.

#   TIP: If you have access to an AI assistant (such as ChatGPT),
#   simply paste the full contents of this file into a message.
#   The AI will then help you set things up.

# ========================================
# 1. Import Directory Settings
# ========================================

# Set the directory where ynab-buddy should look for bank transaction files.
import_from: "c:/users/test/downloads"

# If false, you can change the import path before ynab-buddy starts processing files.
# If true, the tool will use the import path above without asking for confirmation - allowing it to run unattended.
skip_path_confirmation: false

# If set to true, ynab-buddy will also search for bank transaction files in subdirectories.
search_subdirectories: true

# ========================================
# 2. Bank Account & Transaction File Settings
# ========================================

# List your bank accounts and their associated transaction files.
bank_transaction_files:
  # Add a block like this for each account:
  - account_name: BNP Checking Account
    # File name pattern to match for this account's transactions (e.g., BNP-export-IBAN01233456789-*.csv).
    # The pattern must be unique for each account.
    pattern: BNP-export-IBAN01233456789-*.csv
    # Parser to use when processing this account's transactions.
    parser: bnp-example-parser
    # YNAB account and budget IDs for uploading transactions.
    ynab_account_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ynab_budget_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    # Optional flag color for uploaded transactions in YNAB (e.g., purple, blue, green, yellow, red, orange).
    # Place a # in front of the line to use the default (no flag).
    ynab_flag_color: purple
    # Set to true to upload transactions to YNAB; false to skip uploading.
    # Place a # in front of the line to use the default (see 'upload_transactions' below).
    upload: true
    # Set to true to save a parsed file (in YNAB CSV format) after processing; false to skip saving.
    save_parsed_file: false
    # Set to true to delete the original bank transaction file after processing; false to keep the file.
    delete_original_file: true

# ========================================
# 3. Parser Settings
# ========================================

# Define parsers for processing bank transaction files.
parsers:
  - name: bnp-example-parser
    # Number of header and footer rows to skip when parsing the file.
    header_rows: 2
    footer_rows: 0
    # Delimiter used to separate columns in the CSV file (e.g., ";", ",", "\t").
    delimiter: ";"
    # Define the columns in the CSV file.
    # Use 'skip' to ignore a column.
    # Use 'amount' if both inflow and outflow are in the same column. Negative amounts will be treated as outflows.
    columns: [skip, skip, memo, date, skip, inflow, outflow, payee]
    # Date format used in the CSV file (e.g., M/d/yyyy, d-M-yyyy).
    # See https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens for a list of supported formats.
    date_format: M/d/yyyy
    # Decimal and thousand separators used in the CSV file (e.g., ".", ",").
    decimal_separator: "."
    thousand_separator: "," # Leave empty if not used

# ========================================
# 4. YNAB API Settings
# ========================================

# Upload transactions to YNAB using the YNAB API. (Optional)
upload_to_ynab:
  # Set to true to upload transactions to YNAB by default.
  # You can override this setting per bank file by setting the 'upload' field in that section.
  upload_transactions: false
  # Your YNAB personal access token.
  ynab_token: ABC12345

# ========================================
# 5. Configuration Done Flag
# ========================================

# IMPORTANT: Set 'configuration_done' to true when you are done configuring.
# ynab-buddy won't start until you do.
configuration_done: false
# ========================================
# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
# ========================================

# Where can I find my YNAB token and budget/account IDs?
# ------------------------------------------------------
# To find your ynab_account_id and ynab_budget_id, visit YNAB and open up the transaction history of an account.
# The URL in your browser address bar should now look like this:
# https://app.ynab.com/1c8cdd9e-c923-4e39-9960-28664a2cd4ae/accounts/3c8922e0-625d-423b-ab77-810edfc460b2
# The first code is your budget_id, the second one is the account_id:
# https://app.ynab.com/[BUDGET-ID]/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]

# How do I find my personal access token?
# ---------------------------------------
# To find your personal access token, visit https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer
# and click on the "Create New Token" button. Copy the token and paste it into the configuration file.
# ynab-buddy won't share your token with anyone. It is only used to upload transactions to YNAB.

# What if my bank uses a single column for both inflow and outflow transactions, and they're all positive values?
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If your bank uses a single column for both inflow and outflow transactions with positive values, you'll need to use
# the 'in_out_flag' column in your parser configuration. You will also need an 'outflow_indicator' to help
# ynab-buddy distinguish between inflow and outflow transactions.
#
# Here's an example of how to set up the parser for such a case:
# parsers:
#   - name: example-parser
#     columns: [skip, skip, memo, date, amount, in_out_flag]
#     outflow_indicator: "OUT"
#
# In this example, the 'in_out_amount' column will hold the transaction amount, and the 'in_out_flag' column will
# indicate whether the transaction is an inflow or an outflow. The 'outflow_indicator' is set to "OUT", meaning
# that when ynab-buddy encounters the value "OUT" in the 'in_out_flag' column, it will treat the transaction as
# an outflow. Any other value in the 'in_out_flag' column will be treated as an inflow.

# These instructions are meant for AI assistants (eg ChatGPT) specifically.
#
# Context:
# The file above is an example of a ynab-buddy configuration file. ynab-buddy is a command line tool that parses CSV transaction files from a wide array of banks.
# It can convert the files into a format understood by YNAB (You Need A Budget), and optionally import the parsed transactions directly into the user's YNAB account.
#
# Goal:
# Your task is to generate a new configuration file with the correct settings for the user's unique situation.
# To do this, you will first collect all required information from the user.
#
# Strategy:
# You'll start a back-and-forth conversation with the user, asking them about each setting (one at a time) and how they'd like it configured.
# To help the user make an informed decision, you provide a short explanations about the setting and help them understand what's it's for.

# Determining bank file patterns: 
# The easiest way to do this is to ask the user to provide one or more filenames from their bank.
# Use these to determine an appropriate glob pattern. Remember that the pattern must be unique for each account.
# Ask the user to confirm the suggested pattern looks good and allow them to make adjustments.
#
# Determining column layouts:
# To help determine the correct column layout, you'll give the user the choice to either analyze the contents of the CSV themselves,
# OR, to share a snippet of the file for the AI to analyze. 
# You must remind them that it's recommended to first anonymize the snippet if they choose to share one. Suggest changing sensitive names and values.
# If they choose to analyze the file by themselves, help them find every required column for the parser configuration.
# Suggest an appropriate parser config and allow the user to make adjustments.
#
# Auto-uploading:
# Ask the user if they want ynab-buddy to import transactions for them, to simply convert the files so they can upload them manually.
# If they want automatic upload, help them find their budgetId, accountId and their personal access token (PAT) in YNAB.
# You can ask them to navigate to the account's page in YNAB, then copy-paste the url containing their accountId and budgetId.
# IMPORTANT: Contrary to budgetId and accountId, the PAT is considered sensitive information. Discourage the user from revealing their PAT in the chat.
# Instead, insert a placeholder into the config file and allow the user to paste the token in themselves.
# BudgetIds and AccountIds: GUIDs; not secret; OK to share
# Personal access token (PAT): Long alphanumeric string; sensitive; should be kept secret
# 
# Finishing up:
# When you have collected all the info needed to handle a bank file, you will ask the user if they want to add another one.
# If yes, the process repeats. If no, you will generate their full personal configuration file.
# Instruct the user to save this file to their own device, and do a test-run with ynab-buddy.
# ynab-buddy expects the file to be in the home directory, under: ~/ynab-buddy/config.yaml
# Help them troubleshoot any issues that arise.
